1 What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A - Scrolling through a list of Netflix episodes to see if they have new ones

2 What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A - When looking for someone in a yearbook, you can open to the middle and see where you are
in the alphabet - based on the name, you'll then know to look at earlier pages or later 
pages to find the name.

3 Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations 
would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A - 7 iterations

4 Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations
 would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A- 3 iterations

5 Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose 
between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A - Linear search would be ideal because binary search doesn't work with unsorted collections.
The lack of sorting means you couldn't get any closer to the desired outcome by starting in the 
middle than you would if you just started at the beginning and went through in order 

6 Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose 
between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A - Binary search is the better option here as it allows you to discard data where you know
the answer ISN'T located, so you'll save time and resources by not searching where you don't
need to.

Programming Assignment:
1 You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the 
dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function findAlbatross(dictionary, target){
  let left = 0;
  let right = dictionary.length - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    if (dictionary[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    }
    if (dictionary[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

2 You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish 
from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function catchFish (fishTank, goalFish) {
  var result = null, value;
  for(var i = 0; i < fishTank.length; i++){
    value = fishTank[i];
    if(value === goalFish) {
      result = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return result;
}

var newFishTank = ['red spot', 'blue spot', 'gold spot', 'silver spot', 'white spot', 'black spot'];

console.log(catchFish(newFishTank, 'white spot'));
console.log(catchFish(newFishTank, 'red spot'));
