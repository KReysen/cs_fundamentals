1)Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A: To describe algorithms without using a specific programming language. This way, they can be understood and implemented by programmers in any language.
2)If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A: Nothing, as it is not a programming language - it can only be understood by humans, not computers.

Exercises

1)Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
  PRINT the first number
ELSE 
  PRINT the second number
END IF

2)Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET number equal to 1
WHILE the number is less than 101
  PRINT the number
  INCREMENT the number
END WHILE

3)Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

SET target phone number
SET index number to 0
FOR each number in index
IF phone number at index number equals target phone number
  RETURN index number
ELSE 
  increment index number

4)Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

const targetPhone = 5558765309;
var i;
for (i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++) {
  if (phoneBook[i] == targetPhone) {
    return phoneBook[i]
  } 
}
