1 What is time complexity and what is its relation to algorithms?
A- Time complexity is the way we calculate an algorithm's efficiency. It is a function
that determines how fast the run time of the program grows as we add more input to the program

2 What is runtime?
A - Runtime is the time duration of an algorithm (how long it takes to run) but is often
used synonymously with time complexity 

3 How is the runtime of an algorithm calculated?
A- To calculate the runtime, we add up how many instructions the algorithm has to execute
depending on the size of its input, then simplify the expression to the largest term and
drop any constants

4 Name the six types of algorithm growth rates we saw in this checkpoint and list them in order 
of most efficient to least efficient. Now Google another algorithmic growth rate not 
covered and place it in the correct spot in your list.
a - Constant Growth Rate  O(1) (as input increases, runtime stays the same)
b - Logarithmic Growth Rate O(log n) (runtime increases by 1 unit each time input doubles, 
    commonly seen in binary searches)
c - Linear Growth Rate O(n)  (runtime and input size directly proportional, like in for loop)
d - Log-linear Growth Rate O(n log n) (heap and merge sort)
e - Quadratic Growth Rate O(n^2)  (for loop within for loop)
f - Cubic Growth Rate )(n^3)
g - Exponential Growth Rate O(2^n) (growth doubles with each increase in input - recursive functions)

5 Choose one of the algorithmic growth rates from the last question and make a comparison 
to a real-life situation.
A - When humans are perceiving the intensity of a sound, our perception of its intensity 
increases logarithmically so we measure sound intensity in decibels. 

6 O(n) Linear growth rate

7 O(n^2) Quadratic growth rate

8  O(2^n) Exponential growth rate
